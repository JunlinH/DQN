# DQN-TensorFlow2


TensorFlow implementation of DQN.

This project is implemented with TensorFlow 2. Specifically, this project includes:
1. The implementation of Deep Q-Networks(DQN)
2. The implementation of Deep Q-learning algorithm


### Requirements
- gym
- tensorflow 2.0 or above
- numpy
- OpenCV-Python
- scipy
- matplotlib


### Usage
First of all, install the prerequisites by running:
```
$pip install requirements.txt
```
To train the model, running the file `dqn.py`. You can use the command line:
```
$ python dqn.py
```
By default this model is trained on the Atari game Pong. To train with a different Atari game, change the name of game in the main function in `dqn.py`.
```
main('Your Game Name Here')
```
For any reason (loss of Internet connection, etc.) your training stops without being finished, you can run the file `dqn_reload.py`. Your training will continue from the last automatically saved checkpoint.
```
$ python dqn_reload.py
```
To evaluate the performance of the model. Run the file `model_evaluate.py`. This will give you the average reward per episode metric value of your model.
```
$ python model_evaluate.py
```
To plot the results. Run the file `plot.py`
```
$ python plot.py
```
